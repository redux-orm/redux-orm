/**
 * Defines a many-to-many relationship between
 * this (source) and another (target) model.
 *
 * The relationship is modeled with an extra model called the through model.
 * The through model has foreign keys to both the source and target models.
 *
 * You can define your own through model if you want to associate more information
 * to the relationship. A custom through model must have at least two foreign keys,
 * one pointing to the source Model, and one pointing to the target Model.
 *
 * Like `fk`, this function accepts one or two string arguments specifying the other
 * Model and the related name, or a single object argument that allows you to pass
 * a custom through model.
 *
 * If you have more than one foreign key pointing to a source or target Model in the
 * through Model, you must pass the option `throughFields`, which is an array of two
 * strings, where the strings are the field names that identify the foreign keys to
 * be used for the many-to-many relationship. Redux-ORM will figure out which field name
 * points to which model by checking the "through model" definition.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * class Authorship extends Model {}
 * Authorship.modelName = 'Authorship';
 * Authorship.fields = {
 *   author: fk('Author', 'authorships'),
 *   book: fk('Book', 'authorships'),
 * };
 *
 * class Author extends Model {}
 * Author.modelName = 'Author';
 * Author.fields = {
 *   books: many({
 *     to: 'Book',
 *     relatedName: 'authors',
 *     through: 'Authorship',
 *
 *     // here this is optional: Redux-ORM can figure
 *     // out the through fields itself since the two
 *     // foreign key fields point to different Models
 *     throughFields: ['author', 'book'],
 *   })
 * };
 *
 * class Book extends Model {}
 * Book.modelName = 'Book';
 * ```
 *
 * You should only define the many-to-many relationship on one side. In the
 * above case of Authors to Books through Authorships, the relationship is
 * defined only on the Author model.
