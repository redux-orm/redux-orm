/**
 * Returns a memoized selector based on passed arguments.
 * This is similar to `reselect`'s `createSelector`,
 * except you can also pass a single function to be memoized.
 *
 * If you pass multiple functions, the format will be the
 * same as in `reselect`. The last argument is the selector
 * function and the previous are input selectors.
 *
 * When you use this method to create a selector, the returned selector
 * expects the whole `redux-orm` state branch as input. In the selector
 * function that you pass as the last argument, you will receive a
 * `session` argument (a `Session` instance) followed by any
 * input arguments, like in `reselect`.
 *
 * This is an example selector:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * // orm is an instance of ORM
 * const bookSelector = createSelector(orm, session => {
 *     return session.Book.map(book => {
 *         return Object.assign({}, book.ref, {
 *             authors: book.authors.map(author => author.name),
 *             genres: book.genres.map(genre => genre.name),
 *         });
 *     });
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * redux-orm uses a special memoization function to avoid recomputations.
 *
 * Everytime a selector runs, this function records which instances
 * of your `Model`s were accessed.<br>
 * On subsequent runs, the selector first checks if the previously
 * accessed instances or `args` have changed in any way:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>If yes, the selector calls the function you passed to it.</li>
 *     <li>If not, it just returns the previous result
 *         (unless you call it for the first time).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * This way you can use the `PureRenderMixin` in your React components
 * for performance gains.
 *
 * @param {ORM} orm - the ORM instance
 * @param  {...Function} args - zero or more input selectors
 *                              and the selector function.
 * @return {Function} memoized selector
