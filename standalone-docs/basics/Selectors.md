# Selectors

Selectors are functions that cache their result after they are executed. When you call them again with the same parameters, the result will be returned immediately. This can drastically reduce the performance of web frontends by preventing unnecessary re-rendering of UI components.

Redux-ORM provides a simple API for creating model related selectors. For example, given Movie is a model class registered to `orm`, we can write:

```js
import { createSelector } from 'redux-orm';
const movies = createSelector(orm.Movie);
```

## Argument types

Pass a single primary key, and array of primary keys or nothing as an argument.

```js
movies(state);             // array of all movies
movies(state, 1);          // movie with ID 1
movies(state, [1, 2, 3]);  // array of movies with ID 1, 2 and 3
```

## Mapping models to their fields

A selector can directly retrieve related model references for you.

```js
const moviePublisher = createSelector(orm.Movie.publisher);

moviePublisher(state);            // array of each movie's publisher
moviePublisher(state, 1);         // the first movie's publisher
moviePublisher(state, [1, 2, 3]); // array of each of the movies with ID 1, 2 and 3
```
### Chaining relationship accessors
For relationships, this works in a chained way as well.
```js
const coverBookAuthors = createSelector(orm.Cover.book.authors);
```

## The default is `null`

If the cover or its book don't exist, `null` is returned.

```js
coverBookAuthors(state);            // []
                                    // or [null, null, â€¦] if there are covers
coverBookAuthors(state, 1);         // null
coverBookAuthors(state, [1, 2, 3]); // [null, null, null]
```

## Map over collections using `.map()`

Map selectors to model collections:
```js
const bookAuthors = createSelector(orm.Book.authors);
const genreAuthors = createSelector(
    orm.Genre.books.map(bookAuthors)
);
```
The following would work as well and is equivalent:
```js
const genreAuthors = createSelector(
    orm.Genre.books.map(orm.Book.authors)
);
```

## Prerequisites

You must tell your `ORM` how its selectors can retrieve the Redux branch. You do this by passing a `stateSelector` function to the `ORM` constructor.

```diff
-const orm = new ORM();
+const orm = new ORM({
+    stateSelector: state => state.orm,
+});
```
